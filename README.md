# Random trains
Boltzmann Samplers for combinatorial class of trains. The repository contains three such different classes. The main idea of each class is the same but they differ in the bounds of number of wagons, wheels etc. or the definition of a plank. The trains can be drawn using the server and app written with ejs.
